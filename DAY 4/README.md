✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors Game
A fun and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game where you compete against the computer! 🕹️

📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the 100 Days of Code - Python challenge. It demonstrates the use of randomization, lists, and conditional statements in Python.

The game follows the classic rules:

Rock 🪨 beats Scissors ✂️

Scissors ✂️ beats Paper 📄

Paper 📄 beats Rock 🪨

The player makes a choice, the computer makes a random choice, and the winner is decided based on these rules!

🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ The game starts by asking the player to choose Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).
2️⃣ The computer randomly picks one of the three choices.
3️⃣ The program displays the player’s and computer’s choices with ASCII art or emojis.
4️⃣ The winner is determined based on the game rules, and the result is displayed.

📌 Concepts Practiced
✅ Random Module – Generating random choices for the computer.
✅ Lists in Python – Storing game choices efficiently.
✅ Indexing & Error Handling – Handling invalid user inputs.
✅ Control Flow & Conditional Statements – Determining game outcomes.

✅ Current Features
✔️ Simple command-line interface (CLI).
✔️ Randomized computer choices using Python's random.choice().
✔️ Handles invalid inputs (e.g., entering numbers outside 0-2).
